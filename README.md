# Mango

Mango is an modern terminal editor that focuses on simpleness and OOTB.

It's my hobby project. I really don't know how far I could go. Any advice is welcome.

## Note

Linux only now.

This project is far from mature. Do not use it in the production environment.

## Features

- utf-8 support without grapheme cluster
- mouse support
- simple edit
